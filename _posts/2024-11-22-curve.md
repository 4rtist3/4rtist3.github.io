The Amplified Invariant is a mathematical concept introduced to improve the efficiency of liquidity pools by reducing slippage during trades while still allowing flexibility for price imbalance. It combines aspects of constant-sum and constant-product invariants to create a formula that balances between low slippage (near balance) and tradability at any price.

- Constant-product invariant ($\prod x_i = k$): Used in Uniswap-like pools. It's highly flexible and supports trades at any price, but slippage increases significantly for large trades.
- Constant-sum invariant ($\sum x_i = k$): Used for stablecoins. It has no slippage for balanced trades but cannot handle large price imbalances.
- The Amplified Invariant seeks to combine the benefits of both: low slippage near balance and flexibility for imbalanced trades.

To reduce slippage, a leverage factor $ \chi $ is introduced, which adjusts the shape of the invariant. It allows the invariant to blend the properties of constant-product and constant-sum invariants, improving its efficiency across different trading scenarios.

 The general formula is:

$$
\chi D^{n-1} \sum x_i + \prod x_i = \chi D^n + \left( \frac{D}{n} \right)^n
$$


Where:
- $ \chi $: Leverage factor controlling the curvature of the invariant.
- $ D $: Constant for sum of token values at equilibrium.
- $ n $: Number of tokens in the pool.
- $ \sum x_i $: Sum of token amounts.
- $ \prod x_i $: Product of token amounts.

If this equation holds at all times, users will have trades with a leverage $ \chi $. However, it wouldn’t support prices going far from the ideal price 1.0. The invariant should support any prices (so that we have some liquidity at all times). So Stable Swap makes $ \chi$ dynamic. When the portfolio is in a perfect balance, it’s equal to a constant 
$A$, however falls off to 0 when going out of balance:

$$
\chi = \frac{A \prod x_i}{\left( \frac{D}{n} \right)^n}
$$

The StableSwap Invariant which add $\chi$ into the general formula:

$$
A n^n \sum x_i + D = A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n \prod x_i}
$$

There are two frequent math operations to compute: 

- Compute $D$ given fixed values for $A$, and the reserves $x_1, x_2,... x_n$ with $n$ is the number of coins the pool supports, is fixed at the time the pool is deployed. 
- Given $D$, user wishs to increase the value of one reserve $x_i$ to $x'_i$ and figures how much another reserve $x_j$ need to decrease to keep equation balanced. 


In Curve V1 (StableSwap), $D$ behaves similarly to $k$ in Uniswap V2 - the larger $D$ is, the more the reserves are, and the “further out” the price curve will be. $D$ changes — and needs to be recomputed — after liquidity is added or removed, or a fee changes the pool balance.

Calling $S = \sum x_i$ and $P = \prod x_i$, the equation now is: 

$$
A n^n S + D = A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P}
$$

StableSwap uses Newton’s method to solve the equation numerically because it can not be solved algebraically. StableSwap creates $f(D)$, which is equal to 0 when the equation is balanced. In addtion, is computes the derivative $f'(D)$.

$$
A n^n S + D - A n^n D - \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P} = f(D)
$$
$$
\frac{(n+1)D^n}{n^n P} + An^n - 1 = f'(D)
$$

StableSwap solve for $D$ using Newton’s method: 
$$
D_{next} = D - \frac{f(D)}{f'(D)}
$$

And define $D_p$ as:
$$
D_{p} =\frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P}
$$

The final euation for $D_{next}$ is:
$$
D_{{next}} = \frac{(A n^n S + D_p n) D}{(A n^n - 1) D + (n + 1) D_p}
$$
