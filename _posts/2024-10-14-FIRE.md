On October 1, 2024, Fire Token was exploited, resulting in a loss of approximately $20,000 at the time of writing. Let's examine the details of how this attack took place.

## Exploit analysis

Fire Token is an ERC20 Token. The special thing about Fire Token is that it has the token swap functionality integrated from Uniswap v2. Additionally, the `_transfer()` function has also been modified to use that functionality.

But the issue here is that the `_transfer()` function has a vulnerability when transferring tokens to a Uniswap pair. If the user transfers tokens to a Uniswap pair, the balance of the Uniswap pair is automatically decreased and the `sync()` function is called right after that. This can happen because the system calculates the tax amount based on the transfer amount and after that, the system transfers that tax amount to the dead address.

Any user can transfer multiple Fire tokens to a Uniswap pair. With that condition in `_transfer()`, the balance of the Uniswap pair will decrease, leading to a reduction of reserve value. With this flow, attacker first exchanged 20 ETH to Fire, and he transfered all of received tokens to Uniswap pair. Because an amount of Fire were transfered to dead address, the reserve value of Fire got smaller too.

After that, the attacker used `swap()` of Uniswap pair and got more tokens based on the discrepancy of in the reserve value. He repeated this action until be reserve value droped to the minimum value.

## Conclusion

By sharing our insights on Fire Token exploit, this highlights the critical need for thorough security audits and robust smart contract design to prevent manipulation, especially in decentralized exchanges. Effective risk mitigation strategies must be in place to safeguard user funds in DeFi systems, as even minor flaws can result in significant financial losses.
