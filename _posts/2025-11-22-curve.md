## StableSwap

The Amplified Invariant is a mathematical concept introduced to improve the efficiency of liquidity pools by reducing slippage during trades while still allowing flexibility for price imbalance. It combines aspects of constant-sum and constant-product invariants to create a formula that balances between low slippage (near balance) and tradability at any price.

- Constant-product invariant ($\prod x_i = k$): Used in Uniswap-like pools. It's highly flexible and supports trades at any price, but slippage increases significantly for large trades.
- Constant-sum invariant ($\sum x_i = k$): Used for stablecoins. It has no slippage for balanced trades but cannot handle large price imbalances.
- The Amplified Invariant seeks to combine the benefits of both: low slippage near balance and flexibility for imbalanced trades.

To reduce slippage, a leverage factor $ \chi $ is introduced, which adjusts the shape of the invariant. It allows the invariant to blend the properties of constant-product and constant-sum invariants, improving its efficiency across different trading scenarios.

 The general formula is:

$$
\chi D^{n-1} \sum x_i + \prod x_i = \chi D^n + \left( \frac{D}{n} \right)^n
$$


Where:
- $ \chi $: Leverage factor controlling the curvature of the invariant.
- $ D $: Constant for sum of token values at equilibrium.
- $ n $: Number of tokens in the pool.
- $ \sum x_i $: Sum of token amounts.
- $ \prod x_i $: Product of token amounts.

If this equation holds at all times, users will have trades with a leverage $ \chi $. However, it wouldn’t support prices going far from the ideal price 1.0. The invariant should support any prices (so that we have some liquidity at all times). So Stable Swap makes $ \chi$ dynamic. When the portfolio is in a perfect balance, it’s equal to a constant 
$A$, however falls off to 0 when going out of balance:

$$
\chi = \frac{A \prod x_i}{\left( \frac{D}{n} \right)^n}
$$

The StableSwap Invariant which add $\chi$ into the general formula:

$$
A n^n \sum x_i + D = A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n \prod x_i}
$$

There are two frequent math operations to compute: 

- Compute $D$ given fixed values for $A$, and the reserves $x_1, x_2,... x_n$ with $n$ is the number of coins the pool supports, is fixed at the time the pool is deployed. 
- Given $D$, user wishs to increase the value of one reserve $x_i$ to $x'_i$ and figures how much another reserve $x_j$ need to decrease to keep equation balanced. 

In Curve V1 (StableSwap), $D$ behaves similarly to $k$ in Uniswap V2 - the larger $D$ is, the more the reserves are, and the 'further out' the price curve will be. $D$ changes — and needs to be recomputed — after liquidity is added or removed, or a fee changes the pool balance.

Calling $S = \sum x_i$ and $P = \prod x_i$, the equation now is: 

$$
A n^n S + D = A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P}
$$

StableSwap uses Newton's method to solve the equation numerically because it can not be solved algebraically. StableSwap creates $f(D)$, which is equal to 0 when the equation is balanced. In addtion, is computes the derivative $f'(D)$.

$$
(-A) n^n S - D + A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P} = f(D)
$$
$$
\frac{(n+1)D^n}{n^n P} + An^n - 1 = f'(D)
$$

StableSwap solve for $D$ using Newton's method: 

$$
D_{next} = D - \frac{f(D)}{f'(D)}
$$

And define $D_p$ as:

$$
D_{p} =\frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P}
$$

The final euation for $D_{next}$ is:
$$
D_{{next}} = \frac{(A n^n S + D_p n) D}{(A n^n - 1) D + (n + 1) D_p}
$$

Checking with the code:
![aaaa](/assets/images/curve/curve.png)

$D_p$ is calculated by:

```py
D_P: uint256 = D # D_P = S

for _x in xp:
    D_P = D_P * D / (_x * N_COINS)
```

`xp` is the number of tokens, so the loop will run `n` times. Therefore, we have `D` multiplied by itself `n` times in the denominator.

Then we can compute $y$ or $x'_j$ (the after value of $x_j$) when user increases the value of one reserve $x_i$ to $x'_i$.

$$
A n^n S + D = A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P}
$$

With $S = \sum x_i$ and $P = \prod x_i$. Assume to calculate token y with $D$, $A$, $n$; let adjust the formula $S$ and $P$ a bit:

$$
    S = S' + y \\
    P = P' * y
$$

$S'$ and $P'$ are sum and product of the balances of all token except the token $y$ we want to calculate.

The formula then becomes:

$$
A n^n S + D = A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P} \\
\\
\downarrow \\
\\
A n^n (S' + y) + D = A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P'y}
$$

Again, StableSwap uses Newton's method to solve the equation numerically. This time its creates $f(y)$ and the derivative $f'(y)$.

$$
(-A) n^n (S' + y) - D + A n^n D + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P'y} = f(y)
$$

$$
\frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P' y^2} + An^n = f'(y)
$$

StableSwap-Newton's method for $y$ is: 

$$
y_{next} = y - \frac{f(y)}{f'(y)}
$$

This can be transform to: 

$$
y_{\text{next}} = \frac{y^2 + \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^n P' A^n}}{S' + 2y + \frac{D}{A n^n} - D}
$$

In Viper source, two variables are defined:

$$
b = S' + \frac{D}{An^n} 
$$

$$
c = \frac{D^{n+1}}{n^nP'An^n}
$$

After substitution into the formula, we have:

$$
y_{next} = \frac{y^2 + c}{2y + b - D}
$$

There are two function for $y$ in the Curve source code, `get_y` and `get_Y_D`. The `get_Y_D` function calculates $y$ from D, the same as menthod above. In addition, `get_y` is calcalate new $y$ when an amount of one token $x$ change from $x$ to $x'$.

One point to note is the whitepaper of Curve uses invariant $An^n$ (`A * n ** n`), but in Viper source, the invariant is $Ann$ (`A * n * n`).

This can be understood as such the Curve team defines $A$ as $An^{n-1}$.
