# Zero Knowledge Proof

ZKPs are a way to prove a statement is true without revealing anything beyond the truthiness of the statement. It means like "I could prove you that know the fact without tell you a fact".

- I know value X such that `SHA256(X) = 0x7ace...` but don't tell you X.
- I know how to fill a map with three colors so that every two adjacent regions have different colors.
- ...

The ZKPs have three core properties:
- **Completeness:** Given the statement and the witness, the prover can convince the verifier.
- **Soundness:** A malicious/fake prover cannot convince the verifier of false statement.
- **Zero-Knowledge:** The proof does not reveal anything but the truth of the statement, in particular it does not reveal the prover's witness.

# Groth16
Consider an arithmetic circuit with addition and multiplication gates over $\mathbb{F}$. 

Groth16 is a technique allows you to prove with ZK that you know the values make the arithmetic circuit consistent.

## Quadratic Arithmetic Programs
Assume the given system:

$$\sum_{i=0}^m u_{i,q}a_i . \sum_{i=0}^m v_{i,q}a_i = \sum_{i=0}^m w_{i,q}a_i$$

Where $u_{i,q}$, $v_{i,q}$ and $w_{i,q}$ are public coefficients. If $\mathbb{F}$ is big, we use Lagrange Interpolation (see Notes) to compute $u_i(r_q) = u_{i,q}$, similar to $v_i(r_q)$ and $w_i(r_q)$.

A polynomial that satisfies $u_i, v_i, w_i$ could be written as:

$$\sum_{i=0}^m u_i(x)a_i . \sum_{i=0}^m v_i(x)a_i = \sum_{i=0}^m w_i(x)a_i + h(x)t(x)$$

for some degree $n âˆ’ 2$ quotient polynomial $h(x)$ where $n$ is the degree of $t(x)$, with $t(x)$ is **vanishing polynomial** or we could write $t(x)$ as: 

$$t(x) = \prod_{i = 1}^n (x - r_i)$$ 

Assume $a(0) = 1$ and $a(1), a(2),\dots, a(l)$ are public and we want to prove that we know $a(l + 1), a(l + 2),\dots, a(m)$.

## Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge (NIZK) argument

Let $R$ be efficiently decidable relation. If $(\phi,\omega) \in R$ then we can denote $\phi$ as the statement and $\omega$ as the witness. A NIZK has:

- $(\sigma,\tau) \longleftarrow \text{Setup}(R)$, produces common reference string (CRS) $\sigma$ and a simulation trapdoor $\tau$ for relation $R$.
- $\pi \longleftarrow \text{Prove}(R,\sigma,\phi,\omega)$ providing proof of knowledge.
- $0/1 \longleftarrow \text{Verify}(R,\sigma,\phi,\pi)$ which verifies the proof.
- $\pi \longleftarrow \text{Sim}(R,\tau,\phi)$ The simulator takes input as simulation trapdoor and the statement.

## Non-Interactive Linear Proof (NILP)

NILPs are defined relative to a relation generator $R$, where we assume the relations specify a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, and work as follows:

- $\sigma \longleftarrow \text{Setup}(R)$ work as Setup in NIZK.
- $\pi \longleftarrow \text{Prove}(R,\sigma,\phi,\omega)$ The prover operates in two state:
    - First, It runs $\Pi \longleftarrow \text{ProofMatrix}(R,\phi,\omega)$ where $\text{ProofMatrix}$ is a probabilistic polynomial time algorithm that generates a matrix $\Pi \in \mathbb{F}^{k*m}$
    - Then it compute the proof as $\pi =\Pi\sigma$.

- $0/1 \longleftarrow \text{Verify}(R,\sigma,\phi,\pi)$ which verifies the proof via evaluation of multivariate polynomials, and checking whether the result is 0.

To construct NILP for quadratic arithmetic program of Groth16, we first start at Setup state where we select $\alpha,\beta,\delta,x \in \mathbb{F}^{*}$ randomly. Set $\tau = (\alpha,\beta,\delta,x)$ and the CRS $\sigma$ contains:

- $\beta,\delta$
- $x^i \text{ for } 0 \leq i \leq 2n-2$
- $\alpha x^i \text{ for } 0 \leq i \leq n$
- $\beta x^i \text{ for } 0 \leq i \leq n$
- $\frac{\beta u_i(x) + \alpha v_i(x) + w_i(x)}{\delta} \text{ for } l + 1 \leq i \leq m$
- $\frac{x^i t(x)}{\delta} \text{ for } 0 \leq i \leq n-2$

Assume we know $a(1), a(2),\dots, a(m)$. Pick random values $r, s$ from $\mathbb{F}$ and compute matrix $\Pi$ such that $\pi = \Pi \sigma = (A,B,C)$  ($A, B, C$ are linear combinations of entries of $\sigma$) such that

$$A = \alpha + \sum_{i = 0}^m a_i u_i(x) + r\delta$$

$$B = \beta + \sum_{i = 0}^m a_i v_i(x) + s\delta$$

$$C = \frac{\sum_{i = l + 1}^m a_i(\beta u_i(x) + \alpha v_i(x) + w_i(x)) + h(x)t(x)}{\delta} + As + rB - rs\delta$$

Then the verifier can check the proof by checking this equation:

$$A.B = \alpha + \beta + \sum_{i = 0}^l a_i(\beta u_i(x) + \alpha v_i(x) + w_i(x)) + C\delta$$

If the equation equal $0$, then we can accept the proof. Fpr the simulator, we could pick $A$ and $B$ in $\mathbb{F}$ randomly and compute $C$ such that the above equation is True. Return $\pi = (A,B,C)$.
# Notes
### Lagrange interpolating
The Lagrange interpolating polynomial is the polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $\leq (n-1)$ that passes through $n$ points. This could be written as:

$$P(x) = \frac{(x - x_2)(x-x_3)...(x-x_n)}{(x_1-x_2)(x_1-x_3)...(x_1 - x_n)}y_1 + \frac{(x - x_1)(x-x_3)...(x-x_n)}{(x_2-x_1)(x_2-x_3)...(x_2 - x_n)}y_2 + ...  + \frac{(x - x_1)(x-x_2)...(x-x_{n-1})}{(x_n-x_1)(x_n-x_2)...(x_n - x_{n-1})}y_n $$
